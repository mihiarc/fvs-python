# In the SN variant, the large tree heigh growth model follows the approach of Wensel
# et al. (1987) where the potential height growth is calculated for every tree and modified
# based on indifivudal tree crown ration and rlative height in the stand using equation {4.7.2.1}.
# POtential height growth is calculated using the methodology described in the small-tree height 
# increment model.

# The crown ration modifying function uses Hoerl's Special Function (HSF) form (Cuthbert and
# Wood 1971, p. 23) identified in euqation {4.7.2.2} with a range of 0.0 to 1.0. The a-c 
# parameters are chosen so that height growth is maximized for crown ratios between 45 and 75%.

# The relative height modifying function (HGMDRH) is based on the height of the tree record 
# compared to the top height of the stand, adjusted for shade tolerance. The modifying function 
# is based on the Generalized Chapman-Richards function (Donnelly and Betters 1991, Donnelly 
# and others 1992, and Pienaar and Turnbull 1973), whose parameters are set to attenuate 
# height growth based on relative height and shade tolerance, see equation {4.7.2.3} â€“ {4.7.2.7}. 
# Coefficients for these equations are shown in tables 4.7.2.1 and 4.7.2.2. The modifier value 
# (HGMDRH) decreases with decreasing relative height and species intolerance with a range 
# between 0.0 and 1.0. Height growth reaches an upper asymptote of 1.0 at a relative height of 
# 1.0 for intolerant species and 0.7 for tolerant species.
