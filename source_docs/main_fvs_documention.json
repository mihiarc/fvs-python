    "text": "The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is a model used for predicting forest stand dynamics that is used extensively in the United States. FVS is the standard model used by various government agencies including the USDA Forest Service, USDI Bureau of Land Management, and USDI Bureau of Indian Affairs. It is also used by state agencies such as the Washington Department of Natural Resources and Custer State Park, industry, educational institutions, and private landowners.\nForest managers have used FVS extensively to summarize current stand conditions, predict future stand conditions under various management alternatives, and update inventory statistics. Output from the model is used as input to forest planning models and many other analysis tools. In addition, FVS has been linked to other Forest Service corporate software such as databases and geographic information systems.\nUses of FVS are not restricted to timber management applications. Other uses of FVS include considering how management practices affect stand structure and composition, determining suitability of stands for wildlife habitat, estimating hazard ratings for insect outbreaks or wildfires, and predicting losses from fire and insect outbreaks.\nForest managers are under ever increasing pressure to design and implement stand management alternatives that are biologically and economically sound and meet a wide variety of objectives. Costs associated with timber harvesting are continually increasing and any stand entry must generate enough revenue to justify the treatment. The generated revenue must cover the direct cost of the harvest and also the interest that could have been generated by using those monies in other investment alternatives. Generated revenue can be in the form of direct return on the timber harvested, or in delayed return from increased future revenue as a result of increased tree growth resulting from an intermediate treatment. Meanwhile, forest managers must maintain or improve the health, condition, and scenic value of the landscape, reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, and maintain canopy structure and diversity to satisfy various forest practices legislation. Traditional forest management practices such as clear cutting are often not acceptable. Forest Managers are faced with implementing innovative management alternatives of which the long-term effects on the resource are unknown.\nHowever, forest managers have available to them an ever increasing array of tools which can aid resource management decisions. Computer technology has revolutionized land management decision analyses. Geographic information systems, relational databases, mapping technologies, visualization software, and growth and yield simulators are among the many tools currently available, and other software products are being rapidly developed. The Forest Vegetation Simulator is one of the products currently available to aid forest managers in making sound biological and economical management decisions.",

    "text": "Certain terms are used in discussing FVS that may need further clarification:\nVariant - When equations, such as those for tree growth, mortality, and volume, are developed for a specific geographic area and imbedded in the FVS framework, the resulting model is called a geographic variant of FVS.\nBase Model - The term base model refers to all portions of FVS except the Cover, economic, insect and pathogen, and the Fire and Fuels Extensions.\nExtension - An extension is an additional part of the FVS system that 'extends' the capabilities of the base model to either simulate forest dynamics other than tree growth and mortality, or adds additional analysis capabilities such as those for landscape and economic analyses.\nVersion - The FVS version number is displayed as part of the heading on most output tables. The number represents the code repository revision used to build the FVS software. The version number is of little use to most users.\nRevision Number - A revision number is also displayed as part of the heading on most output tables. The revision number gives the date the particular variant being run was last modified. The revision number is changed when any changes are made to the variant, and therefore it is very important to users. Checking this number against the date of executables available on the FVS web site will tell users whether the executable program they have is the most current revision available. This number should be referenced to specify the revision of FVS used for a particular simulation.\nActivity - An activity is any FVS option that can be scheduled by year or cycle.\nCycle - A projection cycle is a period of time for which increments of tree characteristics are predicted.\nDBH - The initials 'DBH' appear in this document and refer to tree diameter measured at breast height, or 4.5 feet above the ground. Diameter at root collar or DRC may be substituted for DBH for those species on which DRC is commonly measured instead of DBH.\nQMD - The initials 'QMD' appear in this document and refer to quadratic mean diameter for the stand.\nPlot or Point - The terms 'plot' and 'point' are synonymous in this document. The term 'plot' is typically used to refer to either a fixed-area inventory plot or a variable radius inventory point.",

Refer to the Users Guide to the Database Extension (Crookston et al. 2003) for more information. Data in common database or spreadsheet formats can be imported by the GUI. Upon import, a copy of the data is created as an SQLite database file named FVS_Data.db, and this copy is what is accessed when creating and running simulations.\nThe FVS GUI creates an FVS keyword record file (see section 3.1), which contains the information necessary to run the simulation. The GUI also creates an SQLite-formatted output database file named FVSOut.db to which some of the outputs are written when a simulation is run.\nMany of the outputs from FVS can be viewed through the View Outputs feature in the FVS GUI.

    "text": "FVS is a semi-distance-independent individual tree growth and yield model ('semi-' because certain parts of the model localize competition and site variables to a plot (or point) basis within a stand). It treats a stand as the population unit and utilizes standard forest inventory or stand exam data. Local growth rates are used to adjust model growth relationships, which is a distinguishing feature of the model. FVS can portray a wide variety of forest types and stand structures ranging from even-aged to uneven-aged, and single to mixed species in single to multi-story canopies.\nTwo input files are generally used when running FVS. The first, a keyword record file, is required; the second, a tree data file or tree input table in a database file, is required when simulating an existing stand but not required when making a bare ground projection.\nThe keyword record file is the user's way of telling the model what to do. Keyword records can be used to enter stand level parameters such as slope, aspect, elevation, sampling design specification, location such as forest and district, and site productivity. However, stand level parameters may also be input directly from a database (see section 4.2.2.3). Keywords are also used to describe management treatments, control the printing of output, compute custom variables, and adjust model estimates. Keyword records are mnemonic words (keywords) with associated data that provide information necessary and specific to the keyword action. The name of the keyword record file is echoed to the Options Selected by Input part of the FVS main output file for documentation purposes.\nThe tree data file is composed of records containing tree level information. Species and diameter at breast height are required on each tree record, and optional data includes tree count, diameter growth, height, height growth, crown ratio, and various other tree level information typically collected in inventory or stand exam procedures.\nFour output files are generally produced from FVS. The first is produced for each simulation; the last three output files are optional and must be requested via keywords:",

The default cycle length is 10 years for most variants and the default number of cycles is 1 in all variants. However, the cycle length and number of cycles is easily adjusted using appropriate keywords.

    "text": "Certain criteria were used in the original development of the Prognosis Model and these have carried over into the Forest Vegetation Simulator.\n1. Use existing inventory methods as sources of input and produce initial estimates of volume and growth that are consistent with estimates calculated with standard inventory compilation techniques . This criterion ensures that the data obtained in detailed silvicultural examination procedures, as well as in nationwide forest inventories such as those conducted by Forest Inventory and Analysis units, can be used to initiate projections.\n2. Applicable in all timber types and stand conditions encountered in the inventory; growth predictions are consistent with growth rates measured in the inventory . This feature assures that the program can accommodate all stands encountered in the inventory without forcing stands into inappropriate species composition or age structure classes.\n3. Treat stands as the basic unit of management; growth projections are dependent on interactions between trees within stands . A stand is traditionally defined as an area of forest bounded by discontinuities in cover characteristics that are visible on\naerial photographs at scales of approximately 1:15,840. Regardless of how a stand is delineated, the stand is the projection unit.\n4. Incorporate growth of the current inventory into projections. This criterion serves two applications . First, for analyses of individual stands, the samples of current increment localize the projections to allow for unique variations in site and environment that are not represented in the model parameters. Second, for forest-wide planning, the increment samples ensure consistency with inventory compilations of current annual increment and provide essential feedback of effects of past management planning.\n5. Provide links to other biotic and hydrologic components of the ecosystem and to economic analysis procedures for selecting the most appropriate management regimens . By maintaining individual-tree resolution throughout the period of simulated time, estimates of future interactions between the stand and other components of the ecosystem can be based on as much detail as is available from inventories of the present situation. The tree species, however, are only part of the vegetation. Shrub and herbaceous species also compete with the trees and may be valued in their own right for forage and shelter for wildlife.",

    "text": "The general flow of operations within FVS is shown in figure 3-1. It is important to note three things: (1) all stand thinning requests scheduled within a cycle occur at the beginning of the cycle and growth and mortality are based on post-thinning conditions, (2) all regeneration becoming established within a cycle is passed to the FVS tree list at the end of the projection cycle, and (3) mortality occurs after growth and is based on post-growth conditions. In some cases, users must set cycle boundaries considering these attributes so that management activities occur when appropriate. Although the diagram is at a low level of resolution, it does show the relationship between major phases of the program.\nA projection begins by reading the inventory records and the descriptions of selected management options. If periodic increment is measured on a sample of the tree records, the increment equations will be adjusted to reflect unique growth characteristics of the\nstand. The inventory is then compiled to produce tables that describe initial stand conditions. When this summary is complete, the first projection cycle begins.\nEach projection cycle starts with a check of the Event Monitor to see if any custom variables need to be computed or management activities scheduled based on pre-thinning stand conditions. Next, any silvicultural actions that have been scheduled for the cycle are attempted. This is followed by another check of the event monitor to see if any custom variables need to be computed or management activities scheduled based on postthinning stand conditions. Next, periodic diameter increment, periodic height increment, and periodic mortality rate are computed. These estimates are then adjusted for effects of insects and pathogens. Tree records resulting from regeneration within the cycle are created next, and change in crown ratios are computed for each tree record in the projection. Then, the tree attributes are updated, tree volumes are calculated, and tables that summarize projected stand conditions are compiled.\nFigure 3-1 - Overview of the general FVS Processing Sequence",

    "text": "Users communicate much of the information used by the Forest Vegetation Simulator through the keyword system. This simple system consists of a set of mnemonic words (keywords) associated with data (parameters). Data is entered in 10-column wide parameter fields. A single keyword and its associated parameters make up a keyword record. For example, the STDINFO keyword record is used to enter information about the site on which the stand is located ( ST an D INFO rmation). The formatting is fixed, but simple and very efficient.\nAn example keyword record set is shown in figure 4-1. This figure illustrates the syntax of a keyword record file that could be used with the Inland Empire variant of FVS; the content of this example will be understood after reading subsequent sections of this guide. A corresponding tree data input file is shown in figure 4-3 and will be discussed in later sections.\nA graphical user interface (GUI) application can be used to assist with the formatting of keyword records. The user is 'intelligently' walked through parameter selection, and the GUI then formats the keyword records (see section 2.2). However, an understanding of the format and keyword record rules will be beneficial.\nThe keyword always begins in the first column of the keyword record. Depending on the keyword, up to seven additional parameter fields on the record may be used to transmit alpha or numeric data. The program uses the data in these fields when the keyword record is implemented. Each parameter field consists of 10 columns and, if the decimal point is included, or the parameter is an alphabetic or alphanumeric value, the parameter may be entered anywhere within the field. If integer values are used, they must be right justified. The first parameter field begins in column 11 and ends in column 20 on the keyword record. A few keywords, such as the STDIDENT keyword shown in figure 4-1, have\nassociated parameters that do not conform to this format, and therefore require supplemental records containing the necessary information.",

    "text": "A simplifying feature of the keyword system is that default values exist for almost all program options. A keyword is required only if the desired action differs from the default action. For example, the default length of a simulation is 1 projection cycle. If that is the desired action, a NUMCYCLE keyword does not need to be used. However, if the user wants a projection of a different length, the NUMCYCLE keyword should be entered with the appropriate projection length entered in the first field. The example in figure 4-1 is asking for a simulation length of 10 cycles. For the Inland Empire variant, which has a default cycle length of 10 years, this corresponds to a projection length of 100 years (10 cycles with each cycle being 10 years long).\nIt is important to note here that FVS graphical user interface (GUI) programs often have default values different than the FVS defaults. For example, the GUI will typically have a default of 10 cycles. This is not the FVS default, so the GUI automatically creates a NUMCYCLE keyword record and specifies 10 cycles unless the user specifies otherwise.\nIn addition to overall program defaults, most individual parameters associated with keywords have default values. If a parameter field is blank, the default value will be used. All parameter values (those entered and those assigned by default) associated with a keyword record are echoed to the Program Options Section of the Input Summary Table (see section 4.3.1.1). Returning to the example file, field 1 on the STDINFO record is used to specify the Forest Service Region and National Forest in which the stand is located. In the example file, the value entered for this parameter is 118.0 indicating the stand is in Forest Service Region 1 and Forest 18, which is the code used in the Inland Empire variant to represent the St. Joe National Forest. The default for this parameter field, in the Inland Empire variant, also happens to be 118. So in this case, the first parameter field on the STDINFO record could be left blank. The first three parameter fields on the DESIGN record have been left blank, so default values will be used for those parameters.",

    "text": "When making many simulations with the Forest Vegetation Simulator, it is often difficult to remember which individual simulation is displayed in an output table. Two keywords exist that help identify the output tables.\nThe STDIDENT keyword record allows you to assign an identification code to a stand. None of the keyword parameter fields are used, but one supplemental data record is required. This supplemental record contains the stand identification (such as S248112 shown below) in columns l-26. This ID appears with every output table in the main\noutput file. The remainder of the columns, up through column 80 can be used to transmit a 'title' which will also be reproduced at the beginning of each output table. The stand identification must not contain any blanks, and if the stand identification is less than 26 characters, a blank should be used to separate the identifier from the title. This is because the model looks for the first blank character on the supplemental record up to column 26; characters to the left of the blank are taken as the stand identification, and those to the right, up to column 80 as the title. In the example below, the stand identification is S248112 and the title for labeling the output tables is 'SHELTERWOOD PRESCRIPTION FOR USER'S MANUAL'.\nSTDIDENT, 1 = . S248112, 1 = SHELTERWOOD PRESCRIPTION FOR USER'S MANUAL\nIn addition to the stand identification, users may want to enter a special code to identify the silvicultural treatment or management regimen that is simulated in a projection. This code is entered with the MGMTID record. There are no associated parameters, but the code to be used is entered in the first four columns of a supplemental record. When the supplemental record is blank, the code is not printed; when MGMTID is not used, the code ' NONE ' is printed. For example, if a user were simulating a shelterwood scenario, the records\nwould cause the label SHLT to be printed with each table in the main output file.\nThe STANDCN keyword record is similar to the STDIDENT keyword in that it allows you to assign an identifier to the stand. The identifier assigned using the STANDCN keyword record, however, is a control number, which must be unique among all stands in a simulation because the values are used as a primary key with the database extension (see section 8.11).",

    "text": "Many growth prediction equations in the Forest Vegetation Simulator use stand variables such as habitat type, slope, aspect, elevation, site index, and stand location. Stands should be delineated so that these variables are reasonably constant. Stretching this assumption when defining stands, and using some sort of 'average value' for these variables, will increase the likelihood that projections will not be accurate. In particular, aspect is a circular function, and variables such as habitat type and stand location are represented by discrete classes; none of these have meaningful averages. This site level information can also be read directly from a database (see section 4.2.2.3).\nThe STDINFO keyword record is used to supply data on stand variables. This record has seven parameter fields specifying information on stand location, habitat type/plant association/ecological class code, stand age, aspect, slope, elevation, and a reference code for indicating the source of the habitat type/plant association/ecological class code. The\nreference code is used to indicate a habitat type/plant association/ecological class from a literature source other than the one used to fit the variant. The FSVEG database recognizes habitat type/plant association/ecological class codes from many sources. By knowing the literature source, FVS can translate the habitat type/plant association/ecological class code to one recognized by the variant.\nIn our example, the Inland Empire variant is being used, so codes entered must be those specific to this variant. Our example stand, S248112, is located in the St. Joe National Forest (code 118). This stand is on a northwest-facing slope (315 degrees) of approximately 30 percent at 3400 feet elevation (code = 34). The habitat type has been identified as Tsuga heterophylla/Clintonia uniflora (code = 570). This habitat type is one of the habitat types defined for the Inland Empire variant and listed in the variant overview document, so the habitat type reference code is not needed. The stand age at the time it was inventoried was 60 years. The above data are entered into the Forest Vegetation Simulator using the following keyword record.\nSTDINFO, 1 = 118. STDINFO, 2 = 570.

Stand aspect is entered in degrees and slope is entered in percent for all variants.\nSite index is an important predictor variable in many of the FVS variants. Site index and site species is provided to the model with the SITECODE keyword record. A site index can be entered for a particular site species, or site index values can be entered for each individual species. If site index is entered for a particular site species, the model translates that site index to a corresponding site index for each species in the variant for which an individual site index was not entered. If site index is not entered, then variantspecific default values are used. A site index table is printed in the main output file.

There were 11 sample plots within the stand, and 10 of the 11 were considered stockable (i.e., 1 plot considered nonstockable, meaning it is incapable of supporting trees). In this case, the following DESIGN records are equivalent because the default parameters for the first three fields of the DESIGN keyword record correspond to the values used to inventory the stand.

The NUMCYCLE keyword record only contains one parameter field, and it specifies to the number of projection cycles desired. The TIMEINT keyword contains two parameter fields; the first is used to indicate the projection cycle, and the second to indicate how long, in years, this projection cycle should be. In all variants, the default number of cycles is 1 and cannot be increased beyond 40. FVS GUIs typically provide a parameter value of 10, which is the most commonly used setting of this parameter. In most variants the default cycle length is 10 years, although a few variants are based on a default cycle length of 5 years. Users should consult their variant overview document to determine the default cycle length for their particular variant.\nIn the current example, the Inland Empire variant has a default cycle length of 10 years, and a 100-year projection is desired, so we have included the following keyword record to accomplish this.\nNUMCYCLE, 1 = 10\nIn the following example, assume an inventory year of 2003, and a projection to the year 2050 is desired, using a 7-year first cycle to align projection reports with decades (i.e., 1 st cycle running from 2003-2010), and the four subsequent cycles of 10 years each.

The plot ID's are used to determine the number of plots in the stand when a plot count is not provided on the DESIGN record. It is also used to distinguish between plots when computing point density related values.\nWhen non-stockable plots are present in the stand (i.e., plots that cannot support trees), users should insert a record in the data file with a unique plot number and a tree value class code of 8 (see figure 4-3, record 20) for each non-stockable plot, or insert a DESIGN record with the number of non-stockable plots specified, or both.

However, this capability can be easily abused without evaluating the biases (see section 4.1.3.1). Both the method of growth measurement and the length of the period are entered on the GROWTH keyword record (see section 4.2.3.4).\nTree height (HT; measured in feet). Tree height is the second most important tree attribute that is projected. Height is used in the height increment and crown ratio calculations and in computing volume. Heights may be omitted from the tree records or they may be sub-sampled. If omitted, initial heights will be calculated using speciesspecific height-diameter relationships that are imbedded in the program. If height is subsampled, and three or more trees of a species have recorded heights and no apparent top damage, the parameters of the height-diameter equation can be estimated from the input data. In some variants, this occurs automatically; in other variants the user must enable this feature (see the NOHTDREG keyword record in section 7.1.3.1).\nWhen the top of the tree is missing or dead (damage code 96 or 97; see the damage code description in this section), the variable HT should be used to record the actual live height of the tree (see figure 4-2). This is the height that will be projected and used in growth predictions. Trees with top damage are not included in the height-diameter curve parameter estimates.\nTwo additional variables are needed to approximate a taper curve so that volume loss due to top-kill can be estimated (Monserud 1981). These are the estimated height if the tree were not top-killed (NORMHT) and the height to point of top-kill (THT) NORMHT . is initially computed from the height-diameter function, or it is set to the value entered for tree height if the tree height is greater than the height predicted from the height-diameter function.

Height increment is used to calibrate the small-tree height increment model (see section 7.2.2) in the same way that diameter increment is used to calibrate the diameter increment model. By default, if HTG is measured on five or more sample trees of a species with a diameter less than the specified threshold (1 inch for the Alaska variant and 5 inches for all other variants) at the start of the growth period, the model for that species is calibrated (see section 6.4). The minimum number of observations required for calibration can be changed using the CALBSTAT keyword. HTG may be sub-sampled, but trees selected must have a DBH that is less than the threshold (see figure 4-3, records 10, 12, 13, and 26). Users can enter HTG into FVS, either by recording an increment (future or past), or a second height (future or past). If heights are recorded, HTG will be automatically converted to an increment prior to calibration. When the sample tree records are plain text (not in a database) and the value entered for HTG does not contain a decimal point the value is assumed to be in tenths of feet (one implied decimal place).

For periods longer than 5 years, it becomes increasingly difficult to measure increment without destructively sampling trees or using permanent sample plots.

The\ntree records are read from the dataset 2 referenced by the number that is specified in first parameter field on the TREEDATA record.\nOne option is to enter the tree records as supplemental data records for the TREEDATA keyword record. In this case, the dataset reference number (field 1) should be assigned the logical unit number for record input at the computer installation (logical unit 15 on most systems) and a special record containing the data value -999 must be added to the end of the tree record file. The example tree records could be inserted into the keyword record file as follows:\nTREEDATA, 1 = 15.0. 0101 1, 1 = 11LP 115 10 73 4 0 0 0 0 0. 0102 2, 1 = 011 11WH 65 23 30 8 0 0 0 0 0 011.

This is accomplished with an OPEN keyword record in conjunction with the TREEDATA keyword record. The OPEN keyword record requests that an external file be opened. Five parameter fields and a supplemental record are associated with the OPEN keyword record.\nThe first parameter field of the OPEN keyword record specifies a file reference number to be used in opening the file. The supplemental record specifies a file name to be associated with the file reference number. For example, assume the tree data input records are stored in a file called S248112.DAT and the user wants to use those records in a simulation. The following keyword records would accomplish this:\nOPEN, 1 = 50. S248112.DAT, 1 = S248112.DAT. TREEDATA, 1 = 50",

A data screen entered using fields on the TREEDATA keyword supersedes any existing data screen entered with the DATASCRN keyword. The ability to enter a data screen using the TREEDATA keyword is being phased out and users are encouraged to use the DATASCRN keyword instead.\nThe DATASCRN keyword can be used to screen data as they are read into the model. A species or species group, and a diameter range can be entered using parameters on the keyword. Users wanting to screen out more than one species should create a species group using the SPGROUP keyword and apply the screen to the group; multiple DATASCRN keywords are not allowed. Any tree record of the specified species, or in the specified species group, with a diameter that falls within this diameter range (greater than or equal to the lower diameter and less than the upper diameter) is read; all records with species other than the specified species, or those contained in the species group, will be read; and any tree record of the specified species, or in the specified species group, with a diameter outside this range (less than the lower diameter or greater than or equal to the upper diameter) is ignored. This feature is useful to screen excess numbers of seedlings out of the input data, but should only be used with care since the FVS model\ngenerally applies to the entire stand. The DATASCRN keyword must precede any TREEDATA keyword to which it applies.

If a single species code is to be changed, the SPCODES record requires one parameter field to indicate the species for which the code is being replaced. This is followed by a single supplemental record, which contains the replacement species code in columns one through four. The SPCODES keyword record must precede the TREEDATA record in the keyword sequence.\nFor example, the following keyword records would change the species code for lodgepole pine in the Inland Empire variant (the seventh species listed in table 4-1) to LPP.\nSPCODES\n7\nLPP\nIf all species codes are to be replaced, field 1 on the SPCODES keyword record is left blank.

    "text": "The final aspect to consider with regard to the tree records is the interpretation of the periodic growth data. The projection always begins with the heights and diameters that were read as the variables HT and DBH. These variables should be measured at the same point in time. The Forest Vegetation Simulator routinely assumes that DBH is a current outside bark diameter and that DG is an estimate of past inside bark diameter increment (usually based on a 10-year period, but variant specific). Similarly, HT is assumed to be current height and HTG is an estimate of past height increment (usually based on a 5year period, but variant specific). These interpretations can be altered with the GROWTH record. The GROWTH record is also used to define the length of the period over which current mortality (tree history codes 6 and 7) was observed. The mortality observation period is assumed to be 5 years in length.\nAs was described earlier, increment estimates can be either directly measured or computed as the difference between two successive diameter or height measurements. Furthermore, the values for DBH and HT can describe the tree at either the start or the end of the growth period. Consequently, there are four possible measurement method codes, which are coded in fields 1 and/or 3 as follows:\n0 Measurement made at the end of the growth measurement period. Increment measured directly and represents previous growth.\n1 Measurement made at the end of the growth measurement period. A DBH or HT measurement made at the beginning of the growth measurement period is input as DG or HTG and increment is computed by subtraction.\n2 Measurement made at the beginning of the growth measurement period. Increment measured directly and represents subsequent growth.\n- 3 Measurement made at the beginning of the growth measurement period. A DBH or HT measurement made at the end of the growth measurement period is input as DG or HTG and increment is computed by subtraction.\nIf the FVSSTAND keyword record is used along with GROWTH measurement method 1 or 3, the GROWTH keyword record must precede the TREEDATA keyword record in the keyword sequence. This is necessary so past diameters and heights can be stored and passed correctly.",

    "text": "Some FVS applications require the repeated use of a set of keyword records. For example, when the same form and defect correction factors or multipliers are used for a large number of projections, the associated keyword records must be entered with each projection. As an alternative, keyword records that are used frequently can be stored in an auxiliary file. This auxiliary file can then be opened using the OPEN keyword and accessed using an ADDFILE record in each projection.\nFor example, assume some keywords specifying an uneven-aged management alternative are stored in an auxiliary file named 'uneven.key'. The following keyword sequence could be used to access this file:\nOPEN, 1 = 40. UNEVEN.KEY, 1 = UNEVEN.KEY. ADDFILE, 1 = 40\nKeyword records stored in the external file are brought into the keyword set at the point the ADDFILE record occurs. They are listed in the main FVS output file in the section that shows the keyword records that were read. The ADDFILE usually may be inserted anywhere prior to the PROCESS keyword record. Users should be mindful, however, of the implications relating to keyword order. For example, if a TREEFMT keyword record was stored in an external file and an ADDFILE keyword record referenced the external file, the ADDFILE keyword record must precede any TREEDATA keyword record in the keyword record set. Also, the keyword records contained in the external file must not contain another ADDFILE keyword record (i.e., an ADDFILE within an ADDFILE is not permitted).\nWhen a file is opened for data input (see section 4.2.3.1) or in association with an auxiliary keyword set (shown above), it is a good idea to close it. Beyond being tidy, this makes the unit number available to be used again at a different point in the keyword sequence. So a more complete sequence for accessing an auxiliary file would be as follows:\nOPEN UNEVEN.KEY, 1 = 40. ADDFILE, 1 = 40. CLOSE, 1 = 40",

The NOECHO and ECHO keywords turn off and back on, respectively, the listing of keyword records to the FVS main output file. Including these two keywords as the first and last keyword records in the auxiliary file UNEVEN.KEY would accomplish this result.\nIf multiple projections are included in a single keyword set, the auxiliary keyword record file or tree record file may be re-entered without providing additional OPEN keyword records. To accomplish this use the REWIND keyword record to reposition the access point at the beginning of the specified file, and then include another ADDFILE or TREEDATA keyword record to access that file another time.\nThe REWIND keyword record must precede the associated ADDFILE or TREEDATA keyword records in any projection where a tree record file or auxiliary keyword record file are reread. In addition, a CLOSE keyword record should not be used when using the rewind feature, because the file needs to be open at the time the ADDFILE or TREEDATA keyword records are read by FVS.\nAnother keyword that is available, but seldom used, is the ENDFILE keyword record. This keyword record acts as an end-of-file to terminate writing of an output file. This keyword is only used when running FVS on mainframe computer systems while using computer tapes.

    "text": "This section describes the main FVS output file in detail. It begins with a brief overview of the entire file. A detailed discussion of the various tables in the file begins with section 4.3.1.1 following the example output file in section 4.3.1.\nWhen a projection begins, the keyword record file is processed and an activity schedule is prepared. The tree records are then checked for missing data and the growth models are calibrated based on the input increment data. The results of these activities are displayed in the first several sections of the main output file: the Options Selected by Input section, the Options Selected by Default section, the Activity Schedule, and the Calibration Statistics section. These are sometimes collectively referred to as the Input Summary Table.\nAs activities in the activity schedule are simulated, three additional output tables are prepared. These are the Stand Composition Table, the Sample Tree and Stand Attributes Table, and the Summary Statistics Table.\nThe first of these, the Stand Composition Table, displays the distributions of important stand attributes relative to DBH and species. At each cycle endpoint, per acre distributions of trees and total cubic foot volume are described. In addition, total stand volume is displayed for two different utilization standards. Simulated removals are described with the same statistics, and the distribution of trees in the residual stand is then given. Development of the stand is shown by the distributions of volume accretion and volume mortality.\nThe Sample Tree and Stand Attributes Table displays the development of individual trees within the stand. In this table, the attributes of six trees are displayed along with several statistics that describe the stand conditions. The sample trees represent a cross section of the population of trees within the stand and the same trees are usually displayed each cycle. New sample trees are selected if regeneration, thinning, or tree record compression occurs since these events change the stand composition. The stand is described with an age estimate, three density statistics (basal area, crown competition factor, and trees per acre), estimates of average DBH, and average dominant height.\nThe next table in the main output file is the Summary Statistics Table. This table displays a summary of stand development and management activity. This table repeats stand statistics from the previous tables in a concise yield table format with one line allotted to each date in the activity schedule.",

This summary contains valuable information on which activities were dynamically scheduled, which were accomplished, and which were deleted or cancelled.\nFollowing the Activity Summary, Regeneration Tables will appear in the main output file when any regeneration occurs during the simulation. This is a series of tables that\ndescribe the species, trees per acre, and average height of any regeneration occurring in the stand throughout the simulation.\nAn optional Statistics Table can be selected by using the STATS keyword record (see section 4.3.2.1). This table will appear in the main output file right after the Calibration Statistics Table, and just before the Stand Composition Table. This optional table displays a statistical description of the input (inventory) data. It includes volumes, trees per acre, and basal area for each species in the stand. The mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and confidence limits across sample plots are also included for stand totals of these volume and density measures.\nOther optional tables will appear in the main output file when using FVS extensions such as the Fire and Fuels Extension, the Cover extension, or the various extensions dealing with insects and pathogens.\nUsing appropriate keyword records, the following additional optional output files can be generated:",

    "text": "The following pages contain an example output file generated with the example keyword set shown in figure 4-1, the example data file shown in figure 4-3, and the Inland Empire\ngeographic variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator with a revision date of 01.29.2007. A detailed discussion of various tables in the file begins with section 4.3.1 following the example.\nHistorically, the intent was to report variables of two types: (1) biological based variables that affect forest growth, and (2) commodity based variables. As a result, there are two types of tables reported from the FVS model: (1) the biologically based tables which reflect stand conditions on the stockable area only (Stand Composition Table, Tree and Stand Attributes Table, Structural Statistics Table, and reports from the fire, cover, and regeneration establishment extensions), and (2) the commodity based tables and files which reflect stand conditions on the total stand area (Summary Statistics Table, Treelist Output file, FVSSTAND file, and Stand Visualization file).\nAs an illustration of the impact of stockable area, let's assume a 100-acre stand has a nonstockable area (like a rock quarry) covering 25 acres. Calculations based on total area will use 100 acres while calculations based on stockable area will use 75 acres. If there are 6000 trees in this stand, the trees-per-acre value reported in the Stand Composition Table (based on stockable area) will be 80 while the value reported in the Summary Statistics Table (based on total area) will be 60. For tree growth in the forest, the value of 80 is more relevant. For commodities per total unit of ground, the value of 60 may be more important.\nSome of the tables written to the main output file are also able to be output directly to a database. Where this is possible, a notation has been made in the description. But the content of the output database tables is essentially identical to the content in the main output file, so the descriptions are valid for both types of output file.",

Failure to meet this requirement will result in a variety of errors.

Then, factors that scale growth predictions to match the input growth data are computed. These activities are reported in the Calibration Statistics section of the Input Summary Table.\nThis table is arranged by species encountered in the tree input data records. The first line of this section reports the total number of tree records read by species. The total number\nof tree records excludes records that were rejected because DBH was not recorded. It also excludes records of those trees that died before the start of the mortality observation period (tree history codes 8 and 9). The count includes the trees that died during the mortality observation period (tree history codes 6 or 7). These recent mortality records are used to compute the stand density estimates that are used in scaling models and they may be used by some extensions. The number of recent mortality records is given immediately below the total tree record count. These records will be removed from the tree record file before the stand is projected. If either of these counts appears to be inaccurate, the tree history codes, species codes, and tree record format should be checked.\nThe Forest Vegetation Simulator will accept records with omitted height or crown ratio observations. However, these data must be estimated before the stand can be projected. Heights are usually predicted from DBH and species. Users should consult their variant overview document to see which specific equations and parameters are being used to estimate missing heights.\nIf three or more records for a species have measured heights, and the height-diameter calibration suppression flag is not set (see NOHTDREG keyword discussion, section 7.1.3.1) and the parameters of the equation used for that species will be calibrated to the input data. However, records with measured heights but dead or broken tops are not used. The total number of records less the number of records with missing heights and broken or dead tops gives the number of records available for calibrating the height-diameter relationship for a species.",

Users should consult their variant overview document to see which equations are used. However, it's strongly recommended that crown ratios for all sample trees be measured and recorded. If crown ratios and/or heights were recorded, and the output indicates they are missing, the tree record format is probably in error (see section 4.2.2).\nOf the remaining entries in the calibration statistics table, all but the last one refer to the process of computing growth model scale factors. If increment data are provided with the tree records, the large-tree diameter increment model and the small-tree height increment model will be scaled to reflect local deviations from the regional growth trends represented in the models. In order to compute scale factors for either increment model, for any species, there must be at least a minimum number of increment observations. By default this minimum is five, but it can be changed using the CALBSTAT keyword. Diameter increment observations are accepted only from trees that were larger than some threshold diameter at the start of the growth measurement period. This threshold differs by variant, but is generally 3 inches DBH. Users should consult their variant overview document and look for definitions of what size of tree is considered a 'large tree'. Height increment observations are accepted only from trees that were less than 5 inches DBH at the end of the period. The number of records that is reported as available for scaling a\nmodel includes only those records that have measured increments and meet the above size restrictions.\nThe height increment scale factor is used as a direct multiplier of predicted height increment. However, the diameter increment scale factor is used as a multiplier of change in squared diameter (DDS) and is, in effect, a multiplier of basal area increment. The rate of conversion of DDS to diameter increment is dependent on the magnitude of tree DBH.",

    "text": "The scale factors for both models should normally fall between 0.5 and 2.0. The model estimate of basal area increment derived from the extensive database used to fit the model is the best available predictor of long-term growth performance. As a stand is projected through time, the basal area increment scale factors move toward a value that is one-half the difference between the initial scale factor and 1.0. The effect of this transition is to gradually replace sample-based estimates of increment with the model-based estimates.\nThe other entries in the calibration statistics table that relate to growth model scale factors are by-products of the diameter increment scaling process. They indicate how the distribution of the growth sample compares to the distribution of the database used to fit the model. The distribution variances are compared using the ratio of the standard deviation of the residuals for the growth sample to the model standard error. If the values of this ratio consistently exceed 1.0, the user should carefully examine the growth measurement techniques used, including the methods used to delineate stands. It is assumed that stands are uniform with regard to slope, aspect, elevation, and habitat type. If this assumption is stretched too far, the variance in the growth sample residuals will be exaggerated.\nOne table entry is the weight given to the diameter increment sample during scaling. This weight is part of an empirical Bayes estimation process (Krutchkoff 1972) that is complex and will not be explained here. The interpretation of the weight, however, is quite simple. Values in the vicinity of zero imply the models were not adjusted, while values close to 1.0 imply the models were adjusted. The weight is an expression of confidence that the growth sample represents a different population than does the database used to fit the model. In other words, a value of .90 would indicate a 90% certainty that the growth sample represents a different population than the database used to fit the model.\nThe final entry in the Calibration Statistic section shows the number of records on which dwarf mistletoe was recorded as a damaging agent. All western variants of FVS include the dwarf mistletoe extension as part of the base model code (see section 8.3).",

If there are any thinning requests in a cycle, the number of trees per acre and the volume per acre removed as well as the number of trees per acre in the residual stand are reported.\nBy compromising traditional format, the essence of a stand or stock table is captured in a single line of output in the Stand Composition Table. The compromise consists of defining the classes in the table as fixed percentages of the total for the attribute. Thus, the smallest class is defined as the interval between zero and the DBH such that 10 percent of the attribute is in trees that are the same size or smaller (0.1 in the 1990 TREES distribution of the example output). This value is referred to as the 10th percentile point in the distribution of the attribute by DBH. The 30th, 50th, 70th, 90th, and 100th percentile points in the distributions of each of the attributes are also identified.\nThe intervals between these percentile points define five additional classes (10-30, 30-50, 50-70, 70-90, and 90-100). Traditional stand or stock tables can be generated with FVS post-processor programs.\nThe remaining information in the stand composition table concerns the distribution of each attribute by species and tree value class. Tree value class is entered with the tree record; some insect and pathogen extensions may change this value, but otherwise it remains unchanged within a projection. This variable has a value of 1, 2, or 3 and may influence the tree removal priority when the stand is thinned (see section 5.2.4.1). The percentage of each attribute that is distributed to each possible combination of species and tree value (there are combinations totaling 3 times the number of species in the variant) is computed. The percentages for the four largest combinations are then printed.",

    "text": "The growth of individual trees and the stand conditions that influence tree growth are recorded in the Tree and Stand Attributes Table. Per acre values are calculated for the stockable area of the stand only. Information presented in this table gives additional insight into the course of stand development. It also reflects how a cross section of trees in the stand responds to changes in stand structure.\nThe trees that are selected for display correspond to the diameters recorded for the percentile points in the initial trees per acre distribution (note: in the example output file, the percentile points diameters are those shown in the Stand Composition Table on the TREES line for the year 1990). These trees reflect a cross section of the stand and are followed throughout the projection. The initial percentile values are maintained to identify the trees. Beyond the initial report, however, these percentile values do not reflect the actual percentile position of the trees in the stand. After harvest, regeneration, or tree list compression, trees are reselected according to the new diameter distribution percentile points. At the beginning of the projection, and at the end of each cycle, the following attributes are displayed for the selected trees:\n\u00b7 Species and tree value class\n\u00b7 Current DBH (outside bark)\n\u00b7 Current height\n\u00b7 Live crown ratio (expressed as a percent of total height)\n\u00b7 DBH increment (inside bark) for the preceding projection cycle\n\u00b7 Percentile in the stand basal area distribution\n\u00b7 Number of trees per acre represented by the record\nThe stand attributes reported are stand age, stand density, and average tree size. Stand density is described with trees per acre, basal area per acre, and crown competition factor. Average tree size is reported as quadratic mean DBH (the DBH of the tree of average basal area) and the average height of dominants. The average height of dominants is computed by averaging the heights of the 40 largest diameter trees per acre. When the\nstand is thinned at the start of a cycle, stand attributes are repeated to reflect the impact of thinning.",

As a result, there are three fields in each record in which the program inserts user-supplied labels for the output: the sample weight, a stand identification label consisting of up to 26 characters, and a management identifier consisting of four-characters (see section 4.1.2.1). In addition, the summary table reports per acre trees and volume before thinning (to three merchantability standards), per acre trees and volume removed, basal area per acre after thinning, crown competition factor (CCF; see section 7.1.2), average dominant height (average height of the 40 largest diameter trees), and growth period length, accretion, and mortality. Accretion and mortality are in terms of total cubic feet per acre per year in western variants, and total merchantable (pulpwood + sawtimber) cubic feet per acre per year in eastern variants. Per acre values in the Summary Statistics are based on total stand area, and therefore include any nonstockable area.\nThe last two columns of this table report current forest cover type, stand size class, and stocking class (see appendix B).

    "text": "Descriptors of stand structure have become an increasingly important consideration in prescribing management actions to preserve wildlife habitat and watershed values. FVS will search for up to three distinct canopy strata. For each significant stratum, the canopy cover corrected for crown overlap, major species, ranges of diameters, tree heights, and\nheights to crown base are displayed. From these data a structural class is assigned. Per acre values are calculated for the stockable area of the stand only.\nThe Structural Statistics Table (figure 4-5) (Crookston and Stage 1999) displays a description of the number of valid strata, percent canopy cover, and structural class for the stand. Included for each stratum are: the nominal diameter and height, the heights of the tallest and shortest trees, the crown base height, percent canopy cover, major species, and a code indicating if the stratum is invalid, valid, or the uppermost valid stratum. These statistics are output for the stand before simulated harvests and are repeated for post-harvest conditions. This table is printed as part of the main FVS output file when the STRCLASS keyword record is included in the keyword set.\nStand percent canopy cover (PCC) is the percentage of the ground area that is directly covered with tree crowns and is calculated based on the methodologies presented in Crookston and Stage (1999). Generally the crown area of a tree is computed using the formula for a circle as a function of crown radius. Crown radius is estimated using formulae that are different for each FVS geographic variant. Percent canopy cover may be obtained for the entire stand or based on species, tree value class, DBH, or height categories. All percent cover estimates computed in FVS are corrected for canopy overlap.\nPercent canopy cover is computed by calculating the projected crown area represented by each tree record. This is adjusted to a percent using equation {4.3.2.2.1} and summed over all tree records in the grouping for which the percent canopy cover is being calculated. The sum is then corrected for canopy overlap using equation {4.3.2.2.2}.\n{4.3.2.2.1} C = 100 \u2219 \u2211 (0.00001803 \u2219 FCWi 2 \u2219 TPAi )\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere:",

For tree distributions other than random, the value of the overlap correction factor can be changed using the CCADJ keyword.\nCanopy strata are initially defined by naturally occurring gaps in the distribution of tree heights. The gaps are found when the heights of two trees in a list sorted by height differ by more than 30 percent of the height of the taller tree and at least 10 feet. The two\nlargest gaps define three potential strata. If there is only one gap, two potential strata are defined and if there are no gaps, one potential stratum is defined.\nInitially defined strata must have over 5 percent canopy cover or they are rejected. Nominal stratum diameter and height are computed by averaging the nine sample trees centered on the 70 th percentile tree. Once the strata are defined, the stand is classified as bare ground (BG), stand initiation (SI), stem exclusion (SE), understory reinitiation (UR), young forest multistrata (YM), old forest single stratum (OS), or old forest multistrata (OM) as a function of the number of strata, the nominal diameter of trees in the strata, and stocking.",

    "text": "Several features in FVS relate to the percent canopy cover and stand structure statistics. The classification logic can be tuned to achieve specific goals using the STRCLASS keyword. The Event Monitor contains pre-defined variables relating to the structural class, nominal diameter of the uppermost stratum, and percent canopy cover, and the SPMCDBH function allows the computation of percent canopy cover for any subset of the trees in the stand (see section 5.5.2.2). The THINCC keyword record allows users to thin stands to a specified percent canopy cover within a specified diameter range (see section 5.2.4.2.3).\nThe classification can vary between runs of FVS with different starting values of the random number generator (see section 6.4.2). This behavior is inherent in any classification system based on statistics sensitive to random variation such as average diameter of a subset of trees. When the stratum average diameter is near the class boundary, the classification of the stand in one class versus another is sensitive to the interaction between the arbitrary rules and the variation inherent in the sample data and in the processes of growth and regeneration.\nFigure 4-5 - Example of the Structural Statistics Table from the Forest Vegetation Simulator\nThe Structural Statistics table can also be output directly to a database.

Other management options, such as regeneration or those simulated in various model extensions, may not occur at the beginning of the cycle. If users want these options to occur in a specific year, then cycle boundaries may need to be adjusted to accomplish this. For example, assume in the example presented in figure 4-1, the user wanted the prescription thinning to occur in year 1993. If the user simply substituted 1993 for 1990 on the thinning request, the thinning would still be done in 1990 (i.e., it would be done at the beginning of the cycle in which it was scheduled, which is the cycle from 1990 to 2000). To get the prescription thinning to occur specifically in 1993, the user needs to create a cycle boundary at year 1993. Getting the prescription thinning to occur in year 1993 could be accomplished by adding two TIMEINT keyword records and replacing the NUMCYCLE and THINPRSC keyword records in that example as follows:\nNUMCYCLE, 1 = 11.. TIMEINT, 1 = 1. 3.. TIMEINT, 1 = 2.. THINPRSC, 1 = 7. 1993. 0.999\nThe first cycle has been split from one 10-year cycle into two cycles of length 3 and 7 years. This creates a cycle boundary at year 1993. The prescription thinning scheduled for the year 1993 will occur in 1993 since that year now coincides with the beginning of the cycle in which it is scheduled. The number of cycles was increased from 10 to 11, to still achieve a 100-year simulation. However, users should be aware there is some bias created by using short projection cycles (see section 4.1.3.1).\nAn alternative to adding a cycle using the NUMCYCLE keyword record and adding the two TIMEINT keyword records is to add a CYCLEAT keyword record and specify a cycle boundary at 1993.

    "text": "This section describes available thinning options and illustrates simulation of various silvicultural treatments. Some of the thinning options allow selection of specific trees or classes of trees for removal. In other options, a removal priority is assigned on the basis of species, size (DBH), tree value class (IMC), mistletoe rating, and special tree status. The highest priority trees are then removed until a density target (basal area or trees per acre) is achieved. When using the density target options, adjusting the relative weights of the components in the removal priority formula can control the types of trees removed.\nThe process of thinning involves the removal of trees. The method by which FVS simulates a harvest is very simple. Each tree record within FVS has a tree count attribute that indicates the number of trees per acre the tree record represents. If the other tree attributes (diameter, height, etc.) fall within the harvest parameters, then the tree count attribute is simply reduced to reflect how many of the trees per acre represented by this tree record are removed. It is possible to remove the entire trees per acre representation, or only a portion of the trees per acre representation, for a tree record during a harvest.

In this case, the keyword acts like the THINDBH keyword.\nIf the specified target is nonzero and the cutting control flag is nonzero, then thinning will be from below or above in the specified diameter class to the residual relative density target. In this case, both the specified cutting efficiency and the cutting priority algorithm are used. This is similar to the density target thinning requests described above. However, if the cutting efficiency is set so low that the target cannot be reached, the model recalculates the cutting efficiency to achieve the target. This behavior is different from that of the other density target thinning requests discussed in section 5.2.4.2.1.\nThe cutting efficiency used is reported in the Activity Summary Section of the Summary Statistics Table.\nThe THINRDEN keyword thins to a relative density target as defined by Curtis (1982).

No other silvicultural treatment creates such pronounced changes in the stand for\nlong periods of time. Delays in obtaining stocking, poor stocking, or poor vigor reduce future yields.\nThe chances of achieving a regeneration goal depend on many factors that interact during the regeneration period. The Regeneration Establishment extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator gives land managers a tool to predict the results of regeneration harvests, both as a guide for forest regeneration and as input to growth and yield planning. This extension quantifies results of the regeneration process in a statistically, and biologically sound manner. Uses of the regeneration model include the following:\n\u00b7 Deciding upon a regeneration prescription that best meets management objectives\n\u00b7 Linking regeneration to long-term growth and yield\n\u00b7 Predicting regeneration in long-term projections of succession or uneven-age management\n\u00b7 Developing harvesting schedules\n\u00b7 Helping in other areas of forest planning where regeneration is important for watershed, wildlife, esthetics, and so on.\nTwo versions of the Regeneration Establishment Model are used in FVS variants.

Regeneration, however, can be scheduled for any year during a projection cycle and the trees are then grown to the end of the cycle by the regeneration model. The regeneration model creates a list of tree records describing new trees on  /300-acre plots. A regeneration 1 summary printed in the main output file reports the average probability of stocking for 1 / 300-acre plots, total trees per acre by species, identification of best trees from the list of total trees, and average estimated heights of best trees. New trees are added to plots that correspond to the inventory plots contained in the input data. Predictions are made for each plot, and then averaged to produce stand statistics.\nThe regeneration period is the number of years during which regeneration becomes established as a result of a disturbance. The length of the regeneration period varies depending on many factors, but for the purposes of FVS this period is set at 20 years. Regeneration that occurs after the regeneration period is called ingrowth. Ingrowth is\nboth the result of succession by shade tolerant species and the continued regeneration of trees into gaps in the tree canopy.\nThe Regeneration Establishment Model is invoked following harvesting, growth, and mortality that occurs in the base model, thus the updated inventory is used to predict new regeneration. Regeneration is scheduled through the use of keywords (and by automatic calls in variants using the full establishment model). In a typical situation, a user would schedule regeneration following a simulated harvest. However, users may also want to schedule periodic regeneration to simulate ingrowth. In variants having the full establishment model, the regeneration model is automatically called when trees have been removed or when ingrowth is to be added to the stand.\nSome spatial resolution is achieved in two ways. Although optional, each inventory plot can have unique attributes such as slope, aspect, habitat type, topographic position, and site preparation (see section 5.4.1.2).

At each tally, new regeneration may be added to the FVS tree list and a regeneration summary output table is printed. An example regeneration summary output table is shown in section 4.3 and discussed in section 5.4.4. Tally dates are a function of the cycle length and the year of disturbance. Whenever there is a cycle boundary within the 20-year regeneration period, a tally of regeneration will be predicted and the new trees added to the tree list. Thus, 5year cycle lengths would result in four tallies of regeneration. A series of tallies that occurs during a regeneration period is called a tally sequence.\nRegeneration is assumed to occur in the spring of the year in which it is scheduled. Because regeneration is added at the end of the cycle, which corresponds to the fall of the year, the number of years of regeneration appears to be 1 year less than the cycle length. For example, if FVS were using 10-year cycles beginning in the year 2000, regeneration would be added in the 'fall' of 2009. A total of 10 growing seasons have elapsed from 2000 to the fall of 2009. The new trees would appear in FVS summary tables beginning in 2010.\nMultiple regeneration requests may be scheduled at any time. For example, several species could be planted in the same year. Similarly, several plantings could be scheduled for different times, either during the same regeneration period or different ones.\nThe regeneration model can simulate the effects of site preparation treatments. Individual plots may be mechanically scarified, burned, or left untreated. Site preparation treatments can occur at years other than the year of disturbance, but they should be scheduled sometime during the first tally. Site preparation treatments scheduled after the first tally in a tally sequence are cancelled because some trees from the first tally would be killed, and FVS has no way to predict this mortality at the present time.\nBest trees play a key role in the FVS regeneration establishment model. This role is especially important in the full establishment model. The idea of best trees follows from the fact that many more trees reproduce than will exist in the mature forest (Wellner 1940).

The first tally in a\nregeneration sequence is called a 'tallyone' in Regeneration Establishment Model nomenclature. Each of the other tallies in the sequence is called a 'tallytwo'. At the time of the first tally, planted trees and advanced regeneration are passed to the FVS tree list. By default, this occurs at the first FVS cycle boundary following the date of establishment. Advanced regeneration refers to those trees that germinated and became established prior to the disturbance date. Subsequent tallies in a tally sequence pass trees becoming established since the previous tally. By default, this occurs at any cycle boundary subsequent to tallyone and within 20 years of the disturbance date. For example, a tallytwo occurs in the second FVS cycle boundary following the date of establishment in a simulation running on 10-year intervals, or at the second, third, and fourth cycle boundaries in a simulation running on 5-year intervals.\nTally sequences can be initiated by the user, or automatically initiated by the model. In most cases, users let the model control when a tally occurs. However, keyword records are available that allow users some flexibility in initiating and controlling tally sequences. An ESTAB keyword record initiates a tally sequence. In the full establishment model, a tally sequence can also be initiated by an ingrowth tally or a tally scheduled by thinning requests. Another way to initiate a tally sequence is by using the TALLY keyword record. This keyword record initiates a tally sequence in which a tally occurs any time there is an FVS cycle boundary during the next 20 years.\nFor example, the default cycle length in the Inland Empire variant is 10 years, and a tally sequence would consist of two tallies.

    "text": "Stand management activities are often contingent upon several factors. Thinning may be called for if the stand is too dense, or spraying may be required if an insect population is causing too much damage. In previous sections, FVS users needed to foretell the occurrence of stand conditions that require management actions, and pre-schedule the model options that represent those actions using specific dates or cycles on the FVS keywords. The Event Monitor offers an alternative method of scheduling activities.\nWith the Event Monitor feature of FVS, users specify a set of conditions that must occur, or thresholds that must be reached. The conditions describe an event. Users also specify a set of management activities for the model to simulate when and if the event occurs. For example, a user might want to schedule a thinning only if the stand crown competition factor exceeds 150, trees per acre exceed 500, and age is greater than 20 and less than 60 years. Using the Event Monitor, the condition is specified via a logical expression followed by the activities (represented by FVS keyword options) that are to be invoked when that expression is true.",

This keyword signals the end of the logical expression and the beginning of the activities that will be scheduled only when the expression is true. Activities scheduled by the Event Monitor can include any FVS keyword option (including those found in extensions) containing a cycle number or year in the first numeric field.\nAn ENDIF keyword is entered to signal the end of the activities that will be conditionally scheduled, and that normal FVS activity processing should resume.",

This conditional thinning can be simulated with the following keyword records:\n```\nIF BCCF GT 150 AND BTPA GT 500 AND & AGE GT 20 AND AGE LT 60 THEN THINBTA 0. 300. ENDIF\n```\nThese keyword records are further explained as follows:\nLine 1: IF signals that a logical expression follows.\nLines 2 and 3: The logical expression is coded 'free form' (that is, characters do not need to be placed in specific columns) on one or more supplemental data records that follow the IF keyword. Placing an ampersand (&) at the end of a line signals that the expression is continued on the following line.\nLine 4: THEN signals that the activities (options specified by date or cycle) that follow will be scheduled only when the logical expression is true.\nLine 5: THINBTA is a thinning option that will be scheduled in the same year that the event occurs; thus, a zero is coded in field 1.

    "text": "The Event Monitor evaluates expressions at two different times at the beginning of an FVS growth cycle (section 3.4, figure 3-1): once prior to thinning requests, and once after thinning requests. It is also called from the Fire and Fuels Extension (section 8.2) to compute FFE related variables if the FFE is being used. A logical expression that is based on before-thinning simulation conditions can be used to trigger a thinning request during\nthe same cycle. However, if the logical expression uses values based on after-thinning conditions, this expression may not be used to schedule a thinning for the same cycle. This is because FVS, in its processing sequence, is already past the point of simulating thinning requests for the cycle. A thinning request based on after-thinning conditions can be scheduled for a later cycle by coding a waiting time longer than the current cycle length in the first field on the thinning request keyword.\nCUT is the Event Monitor variable flag indicating whether or not a thinning has occurred. Users can schedule a thinning in response to detecting that a thinning has occurred, but the conditionally scheduled thinning cannot be simulated during the same cycle the event is detected because the event is, itself, another thinning.\nThe Regeneration Establishment Model is called near the end of a projection cycle. Therefore, it is possible to schedule establishment model activities, like site preparation and planting, as a response to simulation conditions before, or after, thinning.\nSpecial considerations when scheduling activities based on Fire and Fuels Extension variables and functions are discussed in section 8.2.1.",

Group 1 variables are always known; users can include them in expressions either by themselves or with those listed in the other groups.\nGroup 2 variables are undefined when the Event Monitor evaluates expressions prior to thinning requests. However, they are correctly defined when expressions are evaluated following thinning requests, even if no thinning requests are scheduled.\nGroup 3 variables measure change and are not defined until after the first FVS cycle. For example, the stand accretion is computed after the second time the Event Monitor evaluates logical expressions each cycle. Therefore, the stand accretion variable is assigned the accretion from the previous cycle. Variables such as DBA (the change in basal area from one cycle to the next) are computed by subtracting the value stored from the previous cycle from the current value. These variables are also undefined until the beginning of the second FVS projection cycle. Group 3 variables are defined after the second cycle starts.\nGroup 4 variables are assigned values by Forest Vegetation Simulator extensions. The value of these variables remains undefined unless the appropriate extension defines them.\nEvent monitor variables and functions that are most commonly thought of as commodity values (trees per acre, basal area per acre, and volume per acre) are based on total stand area, while those most commonly thought of as biological values (stand density index, crown competition factor, crown cover, etc.) are based on stockable area. This is\nimportant to note if users have non-stockable points in their inventory. The pre-defined variable PROPSTK can be used to convert between stand statistics based on stockable area and those based on total stand area. Users would divide a statistic based on total stand area by PROPSTK to obtain a statistic based on stockable area; users would multiply a statistic based on stockable area by PROPSTK to obtain a statistic based on total stand area.\nTable 5-2 - Variables that can be used within expressions are divided into four groups depending on when they are defined.",

It is\nnot always straight forward, or obvious, how to achieve a desired stand level thinning target under these circumstances. However, it can be done using event monitor capabilities.\nFor example, consider a stand with 170 trees/acre distributed as follows:\n\u00b7 50 trees/acre less than 3.0 inches DBH;\n\u00b7 100 trees/acre 3.0 inches DBH and larger, but less than 20 inches DBH;\n\u00b7 20 trees/acre 20.0 inches DBH and larger;\nIf the management scenario is to thin from below leaving 80 trees/acre in the stand, that can easily be accommodated by expanding the diameter range on the THINBTA keyword to encompass the whole stand. Such as the following:\nTHINBTA, 1 = 2001. THINBTA, 2 = 80 1.0. THINBTA, 3 = 0. 999.. THINBTA, 4 = 0. 999.\nSince all trees in the stand are included in the specified diameter and height classes, the class target of 80 corresponds to the stand target in this instance.\nHowever, if the management scenario is to thin from below leaving 80 trees per acre in the stand, but confine the thinning to trees greater than or equal to 3.0 inches DBH but less than 20.0 inches DBH, it's not so simple. Obviously, in this simple example 90 trees must be removed from the middle size class. The remaining 10 trees in this class when added to the 70 trees outside the class would leave 80 trees in the stand. One way to solve the problem is to do the math by hand and code a keyword such as:\nTHINBTA, 1 = 2001. THINBTA, 2 = 10 1.0. THINBTA, 3 = 3.. THINBTA, 4 = 20.. THINBTA, 5 = 0. 999.",

If more than one thinning was scheduled, this would be an iterative, time consuming, laborious, and error prone procedure. The event monitor greatly simplifies the process.\nAs illustrated in previous sections, the event monitor function SPMCDBH can be used to return one of several attributes across tree species, value class, diameter class, and height class. It can be used with live trees, recent mortality trees, or harvested trees. Consider the following sequence:\n```\nCOMPUTE 0 TPAL3 = SPMCDBH(1,0,0,0.,3.) computes live trees/acre in trees < 3.0' DBH TPAG20 = SPMCDBH(1,0,0,20.) computes live trees/acre in trees > 20.0' DBH END THINBTA 2001 PARMS(MAX(0.,80-TPAL3-TPAG20) & ,1.,3.,20.,0.,999.)\n```\nThis sequence computes the variables TPAL3 and TPAG20 as defined above, and uses those variables to set the target on the THINBTA keyword. The value of TPAL3 would\nbe 50, and the value of TPAG20 would be 20, so the value of the expression for the residual target would be 80 (the stand target) - 50 -20 = 10 trees/acre. This THINBTA would leave 10 trees/acre in the 3.0 < DBH < 20.0 range and 80 trees/acre in the stand, which achieves the desired objective. The MAX function is used to ensure that the trees per acre target is greater than or equal to zero.\nThe SPMCDBH expressions could be coded directly into the PARMS statement eliminating the whole compute section and defining two extra variables. So the following expression is equivalent to the entire sequence shown above:\nResults of the calculations are reported in the Activity Summary Section of the Summary Statistics Table.",

However, it is reasonable to expect considerable variation about the expected value of the predictions for any set of values of the predictor variables. Many sites\nperceived to be the same, in terms of the variables used to predict growth, are in fact different, and the differences are reflected in growth rates. The tree is a good integrator of site factors, and tree growth is a good indicator of site capability.\nAvailable increment data are used to modify predictions. Most commonly, data are available for periodic diameter increment. Periodic height increment, on smaller trees, can be readily measured as well.\nThe scaling procedure (Stage 1973), when stripped of statistical condiments, is really quite simple. Both the large-tree diameter growth model and the small-tree height growth model are linear with logarithmically scaled dependent variables. Therefore, the model intercepts are, in effect, growth multipliers. An increment is predicted to match each observed increment for a species, and differences are sorted. The median difference is then added to the model for that species, on the logarithmic scale, as an additional intercept term (see section 7.2 for detailed information).",

Similarly, the attenuation goal in the second example is 0.75 (half the difference between the initial scale factor of 0.5 and one).\nScale factors are calculated for a species with five or more sample trees meeting size requirements for the scale factor (see section 4.2.1 variables DG and HTG). The minimum number of observations required for calibration can be changed using the CALBSTAT keyword record (the minimum value is 3).\nThe calculation of scale factors can be suppressed by inserting a NOCALIB keyword record in the keyword record file. There are no associated parameters. This option is useful when comparing the influence of site characteristics such as elevation, habitat type, slope, aspect, and location on stand development (see related discussion in section 6.5.2.1).\nThe calibration procedure described above changes the increment prediction in a proportional manner. It does not influence the relative effects of the predictor variables and there is no change in the shape of the response surface.\nFVS models are high-level abstractions. The connections between the selected set of predictor variables and physiological processes that actually control tree growth are, at best, tenuous.

The program assigns all random effects to the distribution of errors associated with the prediction of the logarithm of basal area increment. Basal area increment was selected to reflect the stochastic variation because the effects of differing diameter growth rates extend in highly nonlinear ways through most of the remaining components of the model. This distribution of errors is assumed to be Normal, with a mean of zero. The variance of this Normal distribution is computed as a weighted average of two estimates; the first estimate is derived from the regression analysis that developed the prediction function, and the second estimate is the standard deviation of the differences between the recorded growth for the sample trees in the population (transformed to the logarithm of basal area increment) and their corresponding regression estimates. The weights assigned to these two estimates are (1) the number of observations by species and/or habitat type in the database for the model for the prior component of error, and (2) the number of growth-sample trees in the stand for the second component of error (Mehta 1972).\nThe random component of change in tree diameter is treated in two ways, depending on how many tree records make up the stand being projected. When there are many tree records, the effects of any one random deviation on the growth rate of one tree would be blended with many other trees, and the stand totals should be quite stable estimates.\nAccordingly, a random deviate from the specified distribution is added to the logarithm of basal area increment.\nWhen relatively few sample trees represent the stand, however, a different strategy is used. In order to increase the number of replications of the random effects, two additional records augment each tree record. These new records duplicate all characteristics of the tree except the predicted change in diameter and the number of trees per acre represented by the source tree record. The trees per acre value of the original tree record are reduced to 60 percent of its current value. The two new records are given 15 and 25 percent of the original value; thus, the three records together still represent the same number of trees per acre. This process is known as tripling.",

This 'biased' point is indicated by point A in figure 6-2. The second record, representing the upper 25 percent of the error distribution, is given a prediction corresponding to point B; and likewise, the record for the lower 15 percent is given a prediction corresponding to point C. With this method, the weighted average prediction for the three records is equal to the estimate associated with the original record.\nUnless otherwise specified, records will be tripled twice or until additional tripling would exceed the program storage capacity for tree records (currently set to 3000).

These bounds can be changed with the DGSTDEV record.\nRandom errors are drawn from the Normal distribution by using Batchelor's technique as described in Tocher (1963). This technique requires three pseudorandom uniform numbers to produce each Normal deviate. The uniform pseudorandom numbers are generated with the Marsaglia-Bray composite algorithm (Marsaglia and Bray 1968).

The first three of these can be further divided into submodels that pertain to 'small' trees and those that pertain to 'large' trees (see figure 3-1). It is important to understand how these components interact to understand how model multipliers are affecting simulation results.\nFor the diameter growth component, the breakpoint DBH between the small-tree submodel and the large-tree submodel varies by geographic variant and the user should consult the appropriate variant overview document to determine this value. In some, like the Inland Empire variant, the breakpoint is at 3.0 inches DBH. However in others, like the Central Rockies variant, the breakpoint DBH varies by species. The main point to remember is that this is a hard break. That is to say, when a tree's diameter is below the breakpoint, its diameter growth is predicted using the small-tree diameter growth equations, and when it is equal to or larger than the breakpoint its diameter growth is predicted using the large-tree diameter growth equations.\nFor the height growth component, there are two breakpoint diameters. The purpose of this logic is to assure a smooth transition in height growth as a tree increases in size. If a tree's DBH is below the first breakpoint diameter, height growth is predicted using the small-tree height growth equations. If a tree's DBH is above the second breakpoint diameter, height growth is predicted using the large-tree height growth equations. And if a tree's DBH is between the breakpoint diameters, then height growth is a weighted average of the estimates from both the small-tree and large-tree height growth equations.\nThese breakpoint diameters are both variant specific AND species specific, so users should consult the appropriate variant overview document to determine these values.\nThe crown change component operates similarly to the diameter growth component.

When the objective is to simulate a factor that changes overall growth rate, such as fertilization, multipliers needed would probably include a small-tree height growth multiplier, a large-tree height growth multiplier applied only to trees less than the break point diameter discussed for diameter growth (those larger trees still being grown by the height-growth-driven small-tree model), and a large-tree diameter growth multiplier. This set of multipliers would change overall growth rates for all trees while maintaining the height/diameter relationships built into the model. If the objective was to also change this height/diameter ratio, then either a diameter growth multiplier for small trees and/or a height growth multiplier for large trees could be added to the above set. Users should be careful using both a height growth multiplier and a large-tree diameter growth multiplier to simulate a treatment that is expected to increase both height increment and diameter increment. Increases in both diameter growth and height growth can be simulated by applying EITHER a height increment multiplier for small trees OR a diameter growth multiplier for large trees. Both are used together only when the height/diameter ratio needs to be adjusted. Users should consult Hamilton (1994) for more information about the use of multipliers within FVS.\nThere is an additional method by which the mortality predictions can be modified.

If there is a consistent bias in the scale factors for any species, the average value of the scale factors for that species can be entered into the Forest Vegetation Simulator in subsequent runs, and the model will be adjusted accordingly prior to scaling. In effect, the average scale factor becomes a new estimate of the model intercept.\nThe FVS system contains features to help users calculate suitable multiplier values. Generally, this is a six-step process. First, insert the CALBSTAT keyword into the keyword set for each stand in the area and process the stands. This will generate the auxiliary file discussed in section 4.3.3.3. Second, examine the values in this file and determine the source of any values that seem extremely high or low. Errors in the data input records or the keyword parameters could be the cause. Third, for any stands with unresolved sources of error, or with calibration values that are not reflective of the area, remove the CALBSTAT keyword. Fourth, rerun the set of stands. Fifth, run the Calibration Statistics post-processing program to determine the average large-tree diameter growth scale factor and the average small-tree height growth scale factor for the area. Sixth, if these average scale factor values are different from 1.0, enter these values as multipliers using the READCORD, READCORR, and READCORH keywords described above, and rerun the set of stands.\nWhile this might sound like a laborious process, the FVS GUI programs make the changes to the keyword record files, processing the runs, and linkage to the Calibration Statistics very easy.

Furthermore, for stands with more than 100 but less than 200 square feet of basal area in spruce, commercially thin them using a uniform shelterwood cut from below, leaving 70 percent of existing basal area; no re-entry; and establish 220 Engelmann spruce per acre; label this management policy 'SHELTERWOOD'.\nTo simulate this stand management policy, the following keyword set is developed:\n```\nINVYEAR 2001.

The two activity groups labeled with the 'SHELTERWOOD' activity group policy labels will not be considered in this simulation. By simply changing the supplemental record for the stand policy label from 'GROUPSELECT' to 'SHELTERWOOD', the opposite would be true. The activity groups labeled with 'SHELTERWOOD' would be considered, and the two labeled with 'GROUPSELECT' would not. This gives users an easy way to evaluate different management alternatives for a stand, using a single keyword set.

This would result in too much regeneration being simulated (e.g., 220 + 90 = 310 trees/acre).\nUsers need to be aware of a few more rules regarding policy labeling.\n1. If more than one SPLABEL set is specified for a stand, or if more than one AGPLABEL set is specified for a single activity group, the sets specified last will be used and the others will be ignored.\n2.

Any particular management policy is considered only for those stands that have a stand policy label in common with the specified activity group policy label(s).\nPolicy labeling can be very useful in evaluating different management alternatives for a single stand using a single keyword set (as shown in the example keyword set in this section), or for running groups of stands such as all stands in a watershed.",

All facets of predicted tree development are dependent in part on diameter or diameter increment. The behavior of the FVS Model as a whole is, therefore, strongly influenced by the behavior of the diameter increment model and the subsequent use of DBH and diameter increment in the prediction of other tree attributes. The following discussion points out some desirable attributes of the large-tree diameter increment model.\nActually, in most variants, FVS does not predict diameter increment. Rather, it derives diameter increment from predicted periodic change in squared inside-bark diameter (dds) (Stage 1973; Cole and Stage 1972):\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nEquation {7.2.1.1} can be rearranged to become equation {7.2.1.2} to calculate diameter increment.\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe choice of dependent variable is a matter of statistical convenience: the trend in ln(dds) relative to ln(DBH) is linear and the residuals on this scale have a nearly homogeneous variance. These conclusions are based on hundreds of thousands of data points and are consistent across many species represented in western variants and the southern variant.\nIn variants where diameter increment is predicted directly, the estimate of diameter increment is converted to a dds scale to keep other parts of the FVS system consistent across all variants.\nIn most variants, the diameter increment model is specified something like equation {7.2.1.3} (Wykoff 1990).\n2\n12\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere:\nHAB\nis a constant dependent on habitat type, plant association, or site index is a constant dependent on location (National Forest, Indian Reservation, BLM Administrative Unit, etc.)\nLOC\nASP\nis stand aspect\nSL is stand slope ratio (percent / 100)\nEL is stand elevation (usually in hundreds of feet)\nCCF is stand crown competition factor\nCR is ratio of crown length to total tree height\nBAL\nis total basal area per acre in trees that are larger than the subject tree",

The variant overview document will contain the equation specification and coefficient values particular to the variant being used.\nSite factors are included in the model in two general ways. The effects of habitat type and location are readily observed but difficult to quantify. These effects are included in the model by varying intercepts. Slope, aspect, and elevation are treated as continuous variables.\nThe location intercepts are generally developed by first estimating coefficients for each National Forest, or administrative unit. National Forests and other administrative units that have statistically similar coefficients are then grouped into location classes. This same procedure is repeated to group habitat types into habitat classes. As a result, when moving from one administrative unit or vegetation type to another, there is a discrete shift in the increment function.\nA modification of Stage's (1976) transformation to incorporate aspect and slope as a continuous circular effect is used. The modification is the addition of a slope-squared term that allows optimum growth to occur at other than infinite or level slopes. The optimal aspect varies by species. Most species grow better on south facing moderate slopes. Moderate slopes tend to be well drained with adequate soil, and the growing season is longer on the warmer southern exposures.\nElevation is also transformed so that an optimum is possible. That optimum normally occurs at an elevation that is in the middle of the range for a species. Although the optimal level of most predictor variables is within the range of species occurrence, the effects are independently estimated, and there is no guarantee that there exists a site at which all predictor variables are at their optimum level. For example, optimum growth of western redcedar in the Inland Empire variant is expected on a south aspect, 90 percent slope at an elevation of 2300 feet in a cedar/devil's club (code = 550) habitat type in the Nezperce or Clearwater National Forests. This combination of site factors would be difficult, if not impossible to find.\nWithin FVS, errors are propagated from a normal distribution on the log scale and then converted to real scale. Therefore, a log bias correction is not needed. Its application would, in fact, be incorrect and lead to large over predictions of growth over time (Wykoff 2010).",

Through management, stand density and the distribution of trees among size classes can be adjusted, and the development of crowns can be influenced. Trees with large crowns and trees in dominant crown positions will grow more rapidly than subordinate trees with smaller crowns. As stand density increases, the growth rates of all trees will be suppressed. If a stand is thinned by removing the smaller stems, the diameter increment of the residual stems will increase in proportion to the reduction in stand density. Over the long run, the residual trees will have larger crowns, which will enhance future development. If the larger trees are removed, the residual trees will respond with yet faster growth rates because we have improved their position in the canopy.\nTo this point, the growth model has been examined in two- or three-dimensional space. This viewpoint has made it easy to see the influence of a given variable on tree growth. However, this simplistic view can be misleading. Most forest stands are a complex of species and size classes. Within this complex, any change in one of the variables used to predict growth will usually be associated with changes in one or more of the other predictor variables.\nWithin a stand, at any point in time, the largest diameter increment attained by any tree of a given species is likely to be attained by the largest tree of the species. The growth rate of a suppressed tree culminates at a smaller diameter, than does the growth rate of a dominant tree. In a relatively even-aged stand, however, culmination of all trees of a species will occur at about the same time. As a result, at any time, the relationship between diameter increment and diameter is monotonic or sigmoid increasing, with slope depending on stand density. Through time, this relationship flattens and its maximum decreases.",

There may be less than 10 years' growth at breast height, and removal of an increment core\ncould severely damage the tree. However, with many species counting whorls and measuring internodes can estimate height increments for small trees for periods up to 5 years. This is a common inventory procedure.\nHeight growth for small trees is a driving force in tree development as they compete for light and vertical growing space. Because of this, the small-tree portion of the Forest Vegetation Simulator is a height growth driven model. That is to say, for small trees less than some threshold diameter (see section 6.5.1) height growth is estimated first, and diameter growth is predicted from height growth.\nBecause the small-tree height increments can be measured with relative ease, and because the height growth equation is so influential in the development of small trees, FVS includes a calibration procedure for the small-tree height increment model. This procedure is analogous to the procedure used in the large-tree diameter increment model. The median residual between observed and predicted height increments is computed on the logarithmic scale and incorporated in the prediction equation as an additional intercept term.\nEquations used to predict small-tree height increment vary by species and variant. However, they are usually dependent on factors such as site characteristics, stand density, social position, and crown ratio. The variant overview document contains equations and coefficients particular to the variant being used.\nThe difficulty with this approach centers on the choice of a break point diameter at which the switch is made from a height growth driven small-tree model to a diameter growth driven large-tree model. This is best illustrated by discussing experiences developing the North Idaho variant. Stage (1975) developed a periodic height increment model based on the differential of the allometric relationship between height (HT) and diameter (DBH).

All tree records will receive some mortality in a projection.\nMortality rates for individual tree records are determined by an equation that is variant dependent. The variant overview document should be consulted for the specific equation form and coefficients in the variant being used. In general though, the rate is partially dependent on shade tolerance of individual species. The more intolerant species have higher mortality rates than the tolerant species. The rate is also dependent on a tree's social position as measured by its' rank in the basal area distribution. Trees with a lower rank (e.g., understory tree) receive heavier mortality than those with a higher rank (e.g., overstory tree). And finally, the rate is dependent on a tree's vigor as measured by crown ratio. Trees with a lower crown ratio receive higher mortality than trees with a higher crown ratio. The mortality model makes multiple passes through the tree records multiplying a record's trees per acre value times the mortality rate, accumulating the results, and reducing the trees per acre representation until the desired mortality level has been reached.\nA final check is made to make sure the stand does not exceed the basal area maximum sustainable on the site.

Both computations yield exactly the same result.\nZeide (1983) recommended that the mean diameter used in the Reineke calculation should not be the quadratic mean diameter, but rather a value Dr (Reineke's diameter) computed using the 1.605 power and root to account for an aggregation bias in Reineke's calculation. This bias is due to SDI being a function of D 1.605 while quadratic mean diameter used in Reineke's calculation is a function of D . Long and Daniel (1990) 2 showed that the aggregation bias was significant when applying the SDI concept to uneven-aged stands, and published their own summation method (patterned after Stage's summation method) to eliminate this bias when computing SDI on an individual tree basis. This computational method was popularized by Shaw (2000) who provided a shortcut computational method of the Long and Daniel formulation. The Zeide calculation using Dr and the Shaw/Long and Daniel summation method both yield the same result.\nThe two different computational methods discussed above do not produce the same results.

As a result, crown ratio measurements and predictions are subjective, imprecise, and prone to variation in measurement. Nevertheless, the utility of crown ratio as a predictor substantially outweighs the difficulties associated with its measurement.\nJust as with the mortality models, there are several crown models used in different FVS variants.

The first prediction is then subtracted from the second prediction to obtain a difference. This difference is added to the actual crown ratio to effect the change.\nThere are some additional operational constraints on this crown model. Theoretically, crowns should just touch when CCF is equal to 100. It is assumed the effect of density will be negligible below this threshold. When CCF is less than 100, predictions made at the end of the cycle use the same CCF and BA values that were used to make predictions at the start of the cycle. It is also assumed that thinning will encourage crown development. However, when the stand is thinned from below, a trees' basal area percentile is reduced for the residual trees, with the result that predicted crowns are smaller. To avoid this anomaly, when the stand is thinned the same percentile value is used when making predictions at both the start and the end of the cycle.\nFor most species, crown ratio decreases, as the tree gets larger. A dominant tree (as measured by basal area percentile) tends to have a larger crown than a similar-sized tree in a subordinate crown position (assuming the two trees are in different stands).

Next, parameters of the Weibull distribution are estimated from mean stand crown ratio. And finally, individual trees are assigned a crown ratio from the specified Weibull distribution based on their rank in the diameter distribution, and scaled by a density-dependent scale factor.\nChanges in crown ratios from one projection cycle to the next are obtained from the difference in the crown ratios picked from the appropriate Weibull distributions at the beginning and end of a projection cycle. Crown ratios may increase, decrease, or stay the same depending on tree growth and changes in the stand structure. Crown ratio change is bounded to 1 percent per year to avoid unrealistic changes from one cycle to the next when there are dramatic changes is stand structure.\nValues of crown ratio for individual trees are normally assigned between the .05 and .95 percentile points of the cumulative distribution function for the specified Weibull distribution. However, a scaling factor that is a function of stand crown competition factor can change this range.\nThe Weibull-based crown model is very responsive to changes in the tree and the surrounding stand.

The user can control both the number of tree records that will remain following compression, and the percentage of new records that will be determined by finding the largest gaps in the classification space.\nSome care is necessary when calling for tree list compression.

This extension is available with all western variants of FVS and is based on the Hawksworth (1977) 6-class dwarf mistletoe rating system (the tree crown is divided into thirds; each third is rated as 0 = no infection, 1 = light infection, or 2 = heavy infection; ratings for each third are added to obtain the rating for a tree which can range from 0 (no infection) to 6 (heavy infection in each third).\nThe model accounts for three indicators when projecting the impact of dwarf mistletoe on a tree or stand. The first of these is the change in an individual tree's dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR) as mistletoe spreads through a stand. This measure also includes the intensification of dwarf mistletoe within trees that are already infected. Factors that affect the likelihood of DMR increasing, or decreasing, include tree species, current DMR, diameter, stand density, and height growth. The second indicator is the change in periodic diameter growth caused by the dwarf mistletoe infestation. This indicator is based on tree species and current DMR. For some species, low levels of dwarf mistletoe infection have no adverse effects on diameter growth; for other species a growth loss is present even with low levels of infection. The third indicator is the mortality caused by the dwarf mistletoe infestation. Predicted mortality depends on species, DMR, diameter, and site index. As with other insect and pathogen extensions, the estimate of mortality with DMR is compared to the estimate of mortality from the FVS base model, and the greater of the two values is used as the model's estimate of mortality.",
