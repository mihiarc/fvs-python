# Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview of Stand Growth Process

### Grow Individual Tree
- Initialization process:
  - Sets initial DBH
  - Sets initial height

### Stand Initialization
- Create a new stand by specifying:
  - Species (one of: Loblolly Pine 'LP', Shortleaf Pine 'SP', Longleaf Pine 'LL', or Slash Pine 'SA')
  - Initial trees per acre (TPA)
- Initializes individual tree records for each planted tree
- Validates inputs against species-specific ranges

### Growth Simulation
- Runs in timesteps (default 5-year intervals) from age 0 to end age (default 50 years)
- For each timestep:
  1. Updates competition between trees
  2. Grows each tree
  3. Calculates stand metrics:
     - Trees per acre
     - Volume per acre

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Structures and Functionality Logic

### Phase 2: Basic Growth and Crown Models for Individual Trees

### Phase 3: Initialization of Planted Stands (by species)

### Phase 4: End-to-End Simulation of Planted Stands (by species)

### Phase 5: Analysis and Validation
