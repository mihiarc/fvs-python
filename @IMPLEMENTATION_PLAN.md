## Recent Updates

### 2024-01-01
1. Fixed growth rate patterns:
   - Implemented documented competition modifier (0.00167 factor)
   - Corrected crown ratio model based on FVS-SN specifications
   - Added proper size-dependent effects

2. Validation Results:
   - Height-diameter relationships show expected patterns
   - Growth rates transition smoothly between size classes
   - Competition effects follow documented behavior
   - Crown ratio dynamics maintain proper bounds (0.2-0.9)

2. Enhance documentation:
   - Add detailed API reference
   - Create usage examples
   - Document model assumptions

3. Performance optimization:
   - Profile growth calculations
   - Optimize critical paths
   - Add caching where beneficial

### Long Term
1. Additional Features:
