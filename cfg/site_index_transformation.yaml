# Site index transformations between base ages
transformations:
  # Most common transformation is from base age 50 to base age 25

# Site productivity factors
productivity:
  factors:
    - "Soil depth and drainage"
    - "Climate (temperature and precipitation)"
    - "Topographic position"
    - "Aspect and slope"
    - "Soil fertility"
    
  modifiers:
    slope_adjustment:
      description: "Site index adjustment for slope"
      # Typically reduces site index on steep slopes
      
    aspect_adjustment:
      description: "Site index adjustment for aspect"
      # North-facing slopes typically more productive in southern regions
      
    elevation_adjustment:
      description: "Site index adjustment for elevation"
      # Higher elevations typically less productive

# Growth and yield implications
growth_implications:
  high_site_index:
    - "Faster height growth"
    - "Earlier culmination of mean annual increment"
    - "Higher maximum stand density"
    - "Greater volume production"
    
  low_site_index:
    - "Slower height growth"
    - "Later culmination of mean annual increment"
    - "Lower maximum stand density"
    - "Reduced volume production"
