## Ecological Unit Characteristics

### Province Level Classifications

**110 - Coastal Plain Mixed Forest Province**
- Characterized by mixed pine-hardwood forests
- Moderate to high site productivity
- Predominantly loblolly and shortleaf pine with oak-hickory associates

**210 - Outer Coastal Plain Mixed Forest Province**
- Lower elevation coastal areas
- Variable site productivity depending on drainage
- Longleaf pine, slash pine, and wetland species

**220 - Coastal Plain Longleaf Pine Province**
- Historic longleaf pine ecosystems
- Fire-adapted communities
- Sandy soils with moderate productivity

**230 - Southeastern Mixed Forest Province**
- Transition zone between coastal and mountain forests
- Mixed hardwood-pine associations
- Moderate to high site productivity

### Section Level Classifications

Sections (denoted by letters A, B, C, etc.) represent more specific ecological conditions within each province:

- **A sections**: Typically represent the most common or central ecological conditions
- **B sections**: Often represent transitional or edge conditions
- **C sections**: May represent specialized habitats or unique conditions
- **D sections**: Often represent wetland or riparian conditions

## Site Productivity Implications

### High Productivity Sites
- Well-drained soils
- Adequate moisture
- Favorable aspect and slope
- Typical site index: 80-100+ feet

### Moderate Productivity Sites
- Moderately well-drained soils
- Some moisture limitations
- Variable topography
- Typical site index: 60-80 feet

### Low Productivity Sites
- Poorly drained or excessively drained soils
- Moisture stress or excess
- Steep slopes or poor aspects
- Typical site index: <60 feet

## Usage in FVS

1. **Site Index Estimation**: Ecological units help predict site productivity
2. **Species Suitability**: Determines appropriate species for modeling
3. **Growth Modifiers**: May influence growth equation parameters
4. **Regeneration**: Affects natural regeneration probabilities
5. **Mortality**: Influences background mortality rates

## Implementation Notes

1. Ecological unit codes are typically assigned based on field surveys
2. They integrate climate, soils, topography, and vegetation
3. Used in conjunction with site index for growth predictions
4. Help validate species composition in stands
5. Important for long-term forest planning and management
